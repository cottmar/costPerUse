# Cost Per Use

The Cost Per Use app is a tool for users that show the total cost per use of an item instead of looking at the total cost. Users will be able to assess which items were a good investment, or determine which items may not have been worth buying.

## Features

* A database for your items
* The original price paid, photo, functional use of item
* A counter showing the amount of times a user has used/worn an item, with an updated cost per use dollar amount
* Editable pluses and minuses to estimate cost per use
* Sorting: lowest cost per use, highest cost per use, best buys, worst buys, frequently used
* Categories: Clothing, tools, kitchen, pet items, etc. 

## Stretch Goals

* feature to mark an item sold, calculating what amount it sold for, further giving user an accurate amount of their monetary investment.
* Once an item is sold, archive item
* Cost of owning/renting/leasing to find what is the best option for a user

## Getting Started

TBD

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) - The web framework used
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Javascript Runtime Environment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
